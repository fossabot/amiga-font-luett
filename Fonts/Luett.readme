Kurz:         Kleine HiRes-Schrift (8x8, alle Zeichen)

This Amiga bitmap font has been designed for non-interlaced HighRes
and includes separate glyphs for every code point (ISO-8859-1 chars,
all C0/C1 control codes, and even for the null character).

Since there are several technical and usability issues on different
AmigaOS versions if one tries to combine fonts with the same size
and different font flags, the font has been separated into a
proportional font (Luett) and a monospaced/extended font (Luette).

The source code and linkable libraries with the font data are
available at: <https://github.com/nicodex/amiga-font-luett>.
